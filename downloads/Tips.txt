Almost anything grown at home will have a delightful flavor compared to store bought produce,whether it grown organically or not. It will usually have less chemicals and fertilizer used during the growing cycle.  Most individuals think that USDA Certified Organic mean that the item is free of fertilizer and chemicals but that is not the case. The growing process is more restricted, and the farmer must flow certain rules, but some chemicals can be used in limited quantities.Do not let people dictate what you can grow in certain zones. Test the waters and explorer. I have been told I cannot grow certain tropical fruits in my zone but if you are persistent and will put in the extra work it can be done. If I can do it anyone can, with a little bit of hard work.  Feed the soil, not the plants. Provide the soil with organic material each growing season and the insects will do the rest. In the cycle of life, the insects and the micro-organisms will eat the organic matter and their excrement will become fertilizer for the plants. On the biological level fungus and bacteria have a relationship with the plants roots and thrive in the decaying material.Never leave the soil bare for a long duration of time, this will destroy most of the organisms that you have worked so hard to cultivate. Remember feed the soil, not the plants. Provide the soil with organic material each growing season such as compost, wood chips, leaves, rock dust, and worm castings.
