                <h2>A different perspective of doing things</h2>
                <p>
                    Nature has done all the work for us, just observe and mimic the systems she has blessed us with.
                    Soil must have organic matter for plants to thrive. In the forest there is plenty of organic matter
                    which sustains a continuous cycle. The leaves and branches fall to the ground, the insects and
                    organisms digest the organic matter then their waste fertilize the soil. Some of the organic matter
                    that is not fully digested functions as mulch across the forest floor. This is a never-ending cycle
                    that can be replicated in the garden.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I first started gardening, I spent weeks gathering woodchips from the dump in preparation of
                    setting up the system. Woodchip is a very useful tool in the garden that helps reduce evaporation.
                    It can be used as mulch, and over time as it breaks down it promotes the growth of a very beneficial
                    fungi called Mycorrhiza. It has a symbiotic association with the roots of plants and is the same
                    process that happens in nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several other natural items that can be used to enhance the eco-system. Compost which is
                    made from decaying organic matter can also be spread throughout the garden to increase nutrition. A
                    tea can also be produced from the compost to introduce even-more microbes. Rock dust and sea salt
                    can be introduced as food for the micro-organicism. Rock dust and sea salt both have about 90
                    minerals each as compared to regular fertilizer which has 3 (NPK).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Worm Casting is another way of improving the soil. It is probably the most nutrient and biologically
                    dense item of them all. Worm casting can be produced in a worm bin but the best place to have the
                    worms are in the garden. A good way to tell if you have good organically rich soil is to see if you
                    find a lot of worms in your garden. If you build the environment for them to be happy, they will
                    come!

                    most of the organisms that you have worked so hard to cultivate. Remember feed the soil, not the
                    plants. Provide the soil with organic material each
                    growing season such as compost, wood chips,
                    leaves, rock dust, and worm castings.</h4>
