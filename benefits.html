                <h2>Paradigm Shift</h2>
                <p>
                    There are countless benefits from organic gardening, and some are not even fully understood at the
                    moment. The important item that makes all these benefits possible is good quality organic soil. With
                    good quality organic soil your food will taste better as well as this plethora of other bonuses that
                    I will list below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            <b>Taste</b> – your food will taste better because there will be a higher density of
                            minerals in
                            it,
                            which helps to stimulate your taste buds hence the increased flavor. Fruits are usually
                            sweeter
                            because the sugars are higher when the fruit ripen on the tree. In addition, items do not
                            have to be
                            harvested early to extend shelf life therefore they can stay on the plant/tree until
                            maturity as
                            nature intended. The food is only going from your backyard to the tables and not miles
                            across the
                            country.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            <b>Satisfaction</b> – There is no greater joy than picking food out of your garden that you
                            knew
                            you
                            grew with your own two hands. It is such a feeling of fulfillment and accomplishment, a
                            feeling
                            you will not get from buying your food at the store. Not to mention the excerise and vitamin
                            D that you get from working in the yard.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            <b>Chemical and fertilizer use</b> – you might say that makes absolutely no sense. Lets
                            analyze,
                            with good quality organic soil there is no reason to fertilize, because the beneficial
                            insect
                            waste in the soil will provide the nutrients for the plants to grow. As long as you provide
                            an
                            environment for them to stick around you are good. Pesticides are usually used because there
                            is
                            an imbalance in the garden and one species start to take over. If you set up an eco-system
                            to
                            fester the beneficial insect, then they will keep each other in check as nature intended.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            <b> Natural Solutions</b> – another alternative to using pesticides and fertilizer is the
                            use of
                            compost tea. It is a natural solution that is made from several ingredients including
                            compost
                            which is infused with oxygen for several hours. This enhances the biological activity in the
                            liquid and is used to give the plants additional nutrients. It can also be used if you are
                            having issues with getting your insect population under control. Compost tea can also be
                            foliar
                            sprayed onto the plants leaves to deters insects.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            <b> Reduces waste</b> – organic gardening reduces waste on multiple fronts. Since I started
                            gardening
                            my trash has been cut in half. All my organic waste like food scraps, are now either
                            composted
                            or goes in the worm bin.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            <b>Pollution</b> – because of me composting everything and reintroducing it back into the
                            system there is less methane going into the atmosphere. Methane is a byproduct that is
                            produced from organic garbage when it goes to the landfill and is not good for the earth.
                            Also, if more people grew some type of food there will be less demand in the supermarket,
                            consequently less pollution from vehicles in the transportation of items to the store.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            <b>Balanced eco-system</b> – due to the lack of use of pesticides and fertilizers the
                            biological
                            and the beneficial organisms can florish. Most people are not aware but using fertilizer can
                            destroy your soil. It is like giving your kids steroids to grow instead of feeding them a
                            balance diet so they can grow gradually and heathy. The micro-organisms in the soil like
                            mycorrhizal fungi have a more symbiotic relationship with the plant and is there for long
                            term gradual healthy growth instead of short-term spurts.
                            <p>
                                I have never seen so many bugs in my life until I started gardening. Then I had to learn
                                which ones are beneficial and one that are less favorable to the plants. By keeping a
                                balance insect pullulation you use less pesticide, which not only kills the less
                                favorable insects but also the good one including the microbes in the soil.

                    growing season and the insects will do the rest. In the cycle of life the insects and the
                    micro-organisms will eat the organic matter and their excrement will become fertilizer for the
                    plants. On the biological level fungus and baterias have a relationship with the plants roots and
                    thrive in the decaying material. </h4>
