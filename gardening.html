                    My story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Organic Gardening is a new hobby that I started about two and a half years ago and have become
                    passionate about.
                    My philosophy has always been "we should live a balanced life". I have exercised my entire life,
                    ate fruit and
                    veggies, but have also ate my fair share of junk food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have learned so much prior to planting my first seed by doing the dirty work first. I spent hours
                    doing research
                    so it would make the learning process easier when it came to the trial and error phase. There
                    were
                    many things
                    that I learned along the journey that were surprising, and others that were mere myths.

                <p style="font-size:12px"><i>Download our <a href="/downloads/Tips.txt">Gardening Tips.</a></p></i>
                <h3>Based on my Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many myths out there when it comes to gardening. I will try to tackle a few here, but I am
                    sure there will be plenty that I will not address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Probably the biggest misconception of them all is that you need to use fertilizer when gardening.
                    Stated alternately, feed the plants fertilizer and they will grow. <i>Reality could not be further
                        from
                        the truth. I have been gardening for two and a half years and have never used any on my plants.
                        The
                        quality of the soil is of utmost importance. You cannot just use fertilizer to increase its
                        performance.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You need to be a green thumb to have success in the garden. <i>I have never attempted to plant a
                        seed
                        until I recently started on this journey. Well, maybe when I was a kid in grade school, but that
                        would
                        not have given me any additional knowledge that would have made a substantial difference in the
                        process.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bugs on your plants are bad and you need to use pesticide to protect them. <i>I have never used any
                        kind of pesticides on my plants.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mushrooms are bad for your soil and the plants. It is an indication that there is something wrong.
                    <i>I
                        have plenty of mushrooms in my garden and everything is growing fine.</i>

                    <p>
                        Almost anything grown at home will have a delightful flavor compared to store bought produce,
                        whether it's grown organically or not. It will usually have less chemicals and fertilizer used
                        during the growing cycle.
                    </p>
                    <p>Most individuals think that USDA Certified Organic mean that the item is free of fertilizer and
                        chemicals. But that is not the case. The growing process is more restricted, and the farmer must
                        follow certain rules. However, some chemicals can be used in limited quantities.
                    </p>
                    <p>Do not let people dictate what you can grow in certain zones. Test the waters and explorer. Some
                        varieties function better in certain conditions. I
                        have been told I cannot grow certain tropical fruits in my zone. It can be done with
                        persistence and hard work. If I can do it, anyone can!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Feed the soil, not the plants. Provide the soil with organic material each growing season and
                        the insects will do the rest. In the cycle of life, the insects and the micro-organisms will eat
                        the organic matter and their excrement will become fertilizer for the plants. On the biological
                        level, fungus and bacteria have a relationship with the plant's roots and thrive in the decaying
                        material.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Never leave the soil bare for a long duration of time. This will destroy most of the organisms
                        that you have worked so hard to cultivate. Remember, feed the soil, not the plants. Provide the
                        soil with organic material each growing season such as: compost, wood chips, leaves, rock dust,
                        and worm castings.

                <h2>Paradigm Shift</h2>
                <p>
                    There are countless benefits from organic gardening, and some are not even fully understood at the
                    moment. The important item that makes all these benefits possible is good quality organic soil. With
                    good quality organic soil your food will taste better as well as this plethora of other bonuses that
                    I will list below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            <b>Taste</b> – your food will taste better because there will be a higher density of
                            minerals in
                            it,
                            which helps to stimulate your taste buds hence the increased flavor. Fruits are usually
                            sweeter
                            because the sugars are higher when the fruit ripen on the tree. In addition, items do not
                            have to be
                            harvested early to extend shelf life. Therefore, they can stay on the plant/tree until
                            maturity as
                            nature intended. The food is only going from your backyard to the table and not miles
                            across the
                            country.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            <b>Satisfaction</b> – There is no greater joy than picking food out of your garden that you
                            knew
                            you
                            grew, with your own two hands. It is such a feeling of fulfillment and accomplishment. A
                            feeling
                            you will not get from buying your food at the store. Not to mention the excerise and vitamin
                            D that you get from working in the yard.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            <b>Chemical and fertilizer use</b> – you might say that makes absolutely no sense. Lets
                            analyze, there is no reason to fertilize with good quality organic soil. The beneficial
                            insect
                            waste in the soil will provide the nutrients for the plants to grow. As long as you provide
                            an
                            environment for them to stick around, you are good! Pesticides are usually used because
                            there
                            is
                            an imbalance in the garden and one species start to take over. If you set up an eco-system
                            to
                            fester the beneficial insect, they will keep each other in check as nature intended.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            <b> Natural Solutions</b> – another alternative to using pesticides and fertilizer is the
                            use of
                            compost tea. It is a natural solution that is made from several ingredients including
                            compost infused with oxygen for several hours. This enhances the biological activity in the
                            liquid and is used to give the plants additional nutrients. It can also be used if you are
                            having issues with getting your insect population under control. Compost tea can be
                            foliar
                            sprayed onto the plant's leaves to deter insects.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            <b> Reduces waste</b> – organic gardening reduces waste on multiple fronts. My trash has
                            been cut in half since I started gardening. All my organic waste, like food scraps, are now
                            either
                            composted
                            or goes in the worm bin.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            <b>Pollution</b> – because of me composting everything and reintroducing it back into the
                            system, there is less methane going into the atmosphere. Methane is a byproduct that is
                            produced from organic garbage when it goes to the landfill, and is not good for the earth.
                            Also, if more people grew some type of food there will be less demand in the supermarket,
                            consequently less pollution from vehicles in the transportation of items to the store.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                            <b>Balanced eco-system</b> – due to the lack of use of pesticides and fertilizers this helps the
                            biological
                            and the beneficial organisms to flourish. Most people are not aware that using fertilizer
                            can
                            destroy your soil. It is like giving your kids steroids to grow instead of feeding them a
                            balanced diet so they can grow gradually and healthy. The micro-organisms in the soil, like
                            mycorrhizal fungi, have a more symbiotic relationship with the plant, and is there for long
                            term gradual healthy growth instead of short term spurts.
                            <p>
                                I have never seen so many bugs in my life until I started gardening. I had to learn
                                the difference between the beneficials to the plants and less favorable ones. By keeping
                                a
                                balanced insect population, you use less pesticide.  Chemicals not only kills the less
                                favorable insects, but also the good ones, including the microbes in the soil.

                    Mother Nature has done all the work for us. Just observe and mimic the systems she has blessed us
                    with.
                    Soil must have organic matter for plants to thrive. In the forest there is plenty of organic matter
                    which sustains a continuous cycle. The leaves and branches fall to the ground, the insects and
                    organisms digest the organic matter, then their waste fertilize the soil. Some of the organic matter
                    that is not fully digested functions as mulch across the forest floor. This is a never-ending cycle
                    that can be replicated in the garden.

                    When I first started gardening, I spent weeks gathering woodchips from the dump in preparation of
                    setting up the system. Woodchip is a very useful tool in the garden that helps reduce evaporation
                    and can be used as mulch. It breaks down over time, promoting the growth of a very
                    beneficial
                    fungi called Mycorrhiza. It has a symbiotic association with the roots of plants and is the same
                    process that happens in nature.

                    There are several other natural items that can be used to enhance the eco-system. Compost which is
                    made from decaying organic matter, can also be spread throughout the garden to increase nutrition. A
                    tea can also be produced from the compost to introduce additional microbes. Rock dust and sea salt
                    can be introduced as food for the micro-organicism. Rock dust and sea salt both have about 90
                    minerals each as compared to regular fertilizer which has 3 (NPK).

                    Worm Casting is another way of improving the soil.  It is probably the most nutrient and biologically
                    dense item of them all. Worm casting can be produced in a worm bin but the best place to have the
                    worms are in the garden. A good way to tell if you have good organically rich soil is to see if you
                    find a lot of worms in your garden. If you build the environment for them to be happy, they will
                    come!
