                <h2>What I have always wanted to be</h2>
                <p>
                    I have a passion for learning new tasks and have always gravitated towards challenges that stimulate
                    the mind. Since childhood, I have wanted to be an engineer due to its nature of problem-solving and
                    the possibility of creativity. Although it is not the equivalent of the electronics field that I
                    learned during my four years in high school that sparked my interest. I cannot think of another field
                    in
                    modern history that impacts so many different aspects of everyday life.

                    The knowledge from software engineering will help not only in my personal career development but
                    also in my personal life. Understanding, then excelling in the building blocks of how the system
                    works, will be priceless.

                    As my grandmother used to say, “easy come, easy go”. I am not experienced in this field, but I am
                    driven to gain the knowledge to succeed regardless of the challenges. Planning and
                    preparation are the key along with a lot of
                    patience. Gardening, as well as in many other tasks in life, have shown me that it will make the
                    process a bit easier by doing research. During my journey of gardening, there have
                    been
                    a
                    few people that deserved credit, one of them being John Kohler. I have
                    gained a wealth of knowledge by watching his <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/user/growingyourgreens">You Tube Channel</a>. I will approach
                    coding as I do with other things in life which will hopefully bring me success.
